    Message: The corridor is narrow, with rough stone walls that stretch forward
      into shadow. The faint flicker of torchlight glows from sconces along the walls,
      but the flames waver unnaturally, as if stirred by a hidden breeze. The air
      is thick with the smell of damp moss, and faint whispers seem to echo from
      deeper within the hall. <b>Look</b> for a way to escape this place.
