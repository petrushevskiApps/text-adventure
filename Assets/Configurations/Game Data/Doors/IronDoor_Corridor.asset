    Message: "Inspecting the iron door closely, you find no keyhole, latch, or any
      obvious way to open it. The runes etched into its surface pulse faintly, as
      if waiting for something\u2026 or someone."
    NegativeMessage: n/a
  - Action: {fileID: 11400000, guid: cf00954a2b8039d47890ea1a230b56f3, type: 2}
    Message: The medallion flashes brightly, and the runes dissolve into mist. With
      a deep groan, the iron door unlocks and swings open, revealing a grand staircase
      spiraling upward.
    NegativeMessage: "You press your hands against the iron door and try to force
      it open, but nothing happens. The runes flare briefly, sending a cold shiver
      down your spine. No key, no strength, no tool will move it \u2014 the door
      remains immovable, as if mocking your attempt."
  - Action: {fileID: 11400000, guid: faf28f537c3c5b44db53e4ae43b02168, type: 2}
    Message: "You have solved the puzzle of the iron door. Beyond it lies the true
      way out of the dungeon\u2026 or deeper mysteries that await above."
    NegativeMessage: You push and twist at the iron door, but the runes flare violently.
      A shock of magical energy bursts from the surface, throwing you across the
      corridor. You hit the stone floor hard, dazed, and the door remains firmly
      shut.
